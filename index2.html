            <p><strong>4th year Chemical Engineering student</strong></p>
            <p>Hi! My name is Aibangbee Osagumwenro Trust, I'm a 4th-year Chemical Engineering student with a passion for technology, creativity, and digital innovation. While my academic background has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving, data analysis, and process optimization, I’ve also carved out a parallel path in the digital world as a web developer and social media manager.

Over the past few years, I've built responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. I love turning ideas into interactive, functional websites that are both visually appealing and technically sound.

In addition, I manage social media accounts for brands and small businesses — creating content, growing engagement, and developing strategies that align with brand goals. I enjoy using analytics and creativity to connect with audiences and help brands stand out online.

Whether it's optimizing a chemical process or a website layout, I bring the same level of focus, curiosity, and enthusiasm to everything I do.
